## 🌌 Story

You are an alien — powerful, intelligent, and imprisoned in a human laboratory.

Labeled a weapon, your only path to freedom is through the very humans who fear your strength. But you are not helpless. You have the ability to **possess** other lifeforms, absorb their abilities, and use them to fight your way out.

Each enemy is both a threat and an opportunity. Outwit the guards, manipulate your environment, and overcome every obstacle in your way. The lab is a maze of danger, but you are the most dangerous thing inside it.
